# evitaLab developer documentation

Entire evitaLab is built as a pure browser SPA application using [Vue.js framework](https://vuejs.org/). To build the application,
we use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) framework and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager. The current version of 
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) can be found in `.nvmrc`.

For the UI, we use the [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) framework with some design customizations to speed up the UI
building process.
